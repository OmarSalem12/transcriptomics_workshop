# This repo has the material for the Computational biology workshop at Nile University, July 2024

## Bulk RNA-seq analysis

The analysis workflow we cover in this workshop is largely based on this workflow from bioconductor:
[RNA-seq workflow: gene-level exploratory analysis and differential expression](https://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2022/CSAMA/lab/2-tuesday/lab-03-rnaseq/rnaseqGene_CSAMA2022.html)

## Single-cell RNA-seq analysis

The analysis workflow we cover in this workshop is largely based on this tutorial from Seurat:
[Seurat - Guided Clustering Tutorial](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial)
